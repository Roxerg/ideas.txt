A list of short descriptions of ideas however dumb or smart that I *might* just do at some point. Adding this fancy
md just to make it nicer and possibly to link to related projects 

## The List


* Egg app (go wild)

* Uninhabited Island game that is a metaphor of the mind. environmental puzzle adventure

* Video about political activism. not endorsing political views.

* Post Mortem - an app where you can post only once, then you "die". older posts fade away.

* InterNight - sentences about night from all over the internet. auto picked but curated.

* Instagram Vaporwave bot. (scratched the Instragram part. [repo][rep1])

* Raspberry Pi thing that tracks my sleep, creates stats, wakes me up when most efficient?

* Tetris but RTs where buildings keep falling and you need to place them efficiently

* Discovery Society - travel / nature / trekking / interesting location society

* Game where you can add your own music and it influences the gameplay

  * Can "love" animal profile, ranking them for everyone to see
  * Alternatively, can actually contact the shelter via text, messenger, email, etc. 


* program/language/compiler/anything that reads .yeet files

* haiku/poem generator with Markov chains with weights made by analyzing poetry. Could try to mix in internet posts. Alternatively, could just make an average 4chan post generator.
